CONDITIONAL QUESTION PRICING LOGIC
==================================

Conditional questions have their own pricing rules that are applied
when the condition is met and the question is answered.

Example Pricing Setup in Admin:
1. Parent Question: "What type of cleaning?" 
   - Deep Cleaning option selected → triggers conditional question
   
2. Conditional Question: "How many rooms need deep cleaning?"
   - Each room adds $25 to the package price
